            Life Snapshot is a cloud service meant to store documents surrounding the customer’s estate. In the event something were to happen to the customer, those documents would be shared with the intended recipients they designated at the start of the process. The client created a product they felt was missing in the market, a service that was organized but also human at its core. Our task was <span className="underline font-extrabold text-life-snapshot-blue-600">to reflect that brand of Life Snapshot in that web application portal for that customer.</span>

            The brief was very open-ended in terms of expectations and the client made it transparent that they were flexible to any ideas, from interface to functionality. The only thing they specified was the <span className="underline font-extrabold text-life-snapshot-blue-700">color scheme</span> they were striving to stay loyal to and <span className="underline font-extrabold text-life-snapshot-blue-700">a few key screens</span> they would like us primarily focus on.

            About a week in, I took the quotes and phrases collected from our client  and tried to visualize the concepts into moods. In terms of color schemes, I chose to remian loyal to “grey and blue” but in varying degrees for each board. This was to test that “flexibility” the client stated at the beginning of our task.  I placed my ideas in front of users  at the end of that week to gauge <span className="underline font-extrabold text-life-snapshot-blue-600">the appeal of the moods overall</span> and the <span className="underline font-extrabold text-life-snapshot-blue-600">association of that mood with estate planning.</span> Some of my main findings are as follows;

            After some user input, I converted those initial moods to their associated style tiles, a quick impression of the key elements for that mood’s design system. The feedback regarding inclusivity and age was the most influential for me at this stage.  The desired brand of the client was something more modern as opposed to old or traditional. And user’s did not desire those negative associations when engaging with this sort of product, which may carry an unpleasant feeling to begin with.  At the next client meeting, I received further feedback on this example in particular. Here are the key takeaways;

            As we recognized in the beginning, the functionality issues became a major distraction during our desirability testing half through our project. We needed to address some of these issues, but find a way to fix only a small portion as to not fall out of scope. This became more difficult as we dove deeper into our list of screens. We individually took note of areas of concern  in our individual processes and agreed to converge on those ideas for our future recommendations at the final presentation.

            We dedicated one of our user tests to usability. Each designer was given a screen to redesign from the desired screens. The intent was to design questions surrounding the usability of the existing site. Then to replicate those same questions but focus them on our new iterations. This was to see what users thought about the “void” brand and compare those findings to that of our current attempts. This was conducted against our first rounds of high fidelity.

            In the examples above, the layout between the two did not change drastically. For my first iteration, I intentionally kept the layout loyal but made drastic variable changes to the instructions within the section. I discovered that by “dressing up” a problematic layout, those functionality issues actually became more apparent to users. This helped solidify our proposal to the client for a better user experience.

            My main variable in this test was the copy. I wanted to test its effect on the brand as a whole and see if this change altered the impressions of the product. Users responded positively to the change, stating this version was more clear and more human than the previous example. The only issue that arose was the amount of text. Some people found it overwhelming for the task. So the change in tone was successful, now the question was "how much text/instruction is too much?"

                <li className="mb-6"><span className="text-life-snapshot-blue-600">*</span> As for the other areas of the application, I tried to focus on simple layout changes. Could some of these issues just be solved by rearranging the focus of the user? This proved a fruitful endeavor, especially on the dashboard section. Adding elements and reordering the page provided much-needed clarity.</li>
                <li><span className="text-life-snapshot-blue-600">*</span> In other areas, reordering was not enough of a fix. The entire process of file sharing for example was very tricky to untangle, as it was used by customers and backend users. This fact applied to most of the site in fact. Some of the functionality was written with the business side in mind, primarily the customer service department, who interact with the users. With two different types of users, we finally understood that this needed further investigation.</li>

          <p className="pt-6 text-life-snapshot-gray-300">
            Due to the time constraints on this project, I was unable to focus on all the areas that I found needed attention. So my team and I compiled a general list of all the steps we would have taken next:
          </p>

          <div className="pt-8">
            <p className="text-4xl font-extrabold text-life-snapshot-blue-800">1. More usability testing</p>
            <p className="pt-6 text-life-snapshot-gray-300">
              As stated during the process, many such frustrations came up in testing users. These functionality issues were sections we wish we would have time to assist in, but due to the tight timeline for the reskin assignment, they were pushed outside of our scope. We targeted a few areas that the client could focus on moving forward, specifically surrounding the dashboard and user’s opinions on the amount of instruction, as our results were inconclusive.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="pt-8">
            <p className="text-4xl font-extrabold text-life-snapshot-blue-800">2. Transparency and security design</p>
            <p className="pt-6 text-life-snapshot-gray-300">
              While researching the marketing site in the early stages of the project, we discovered several references to the security and authenticity of the service. But this was only apparent on the marketing site if someone was adamantly searching for it. I proposed the idea of adding these references and links to the application directly, to the pages where this could be a concern for the user. It would act as a guide to educate the customer on the service policies, or a reassurance that their documents were safely stored on the site.

              I attempted to change the tone of the application to that of a helpful teacher, someone who is instructive but not too familiar. This approach was welcomed by users for this type of process and they also felt it did not diminish the professionalism of the brand. Since these changes were hailed with such an encouraging response from user and client alike, I encouraged them to apply this formula across their brand along with the design system, something they may not have thought to do based on our brief requirements.

          <p className="text-life-snapshot-gray-300 py-2 lg:py-6">
            User’s had only one consistent critique about my submission; the text was hard to read. To be precise, it wasn’t the typography they had a problem with. I chose a very straight font originally, for a more professional appearance. That particular font at the standard weight is very light and the number styling turned out to be rather distracting with it’s positioning. So the largest change I made was to the body font overall.
          </p>

          <p className="text-life-snapshot-gray-300 py-2 lg:py-6">
            All that remained to finalize was the assets and symbols, specifically, the progress bar for the getting started section, and clarifying the grid for the programmers to utilize. Also cleaning up my sketch file, as that was a requested handoff item from the client.

          <p className="py-3 text-life-snapshot-gray-300">
            The overall response to my designs was very positive. That quote is a line sent to me after our final handoff when the client reached out for some clarifying details and a few past iterations I had shown in previous meetings.

          <p className="py-3 text-life-snapshot-gray-300">
            They had decided to go forward with my design system as a foundation for their brand. That notion only makes me more grateful for the opportunity to enhance this product, and more proud of the final results I was able to create.
          </p>

          <p className="py-3 text-life-snapshot-gray-300">
            Life Snapshot was overall a challenge for remaining in scope while utilizing all aspects of design to elevate the brand. From the copy to the layout of a page, I was able to solidify the process of the application and its purpose for the user. A designer can reskin a brand in more ways than just simply “putting lipstick on it”.
